== Description ==

Let's add banner images to articles and direct users to your site or product.（Call To Action）
Since you can change banner images for each category, you can also guide users to sites that are more interested in users depending on the contents of the articles.
There is no need to embed same images in articles many times from the posting screen!

= About functions =
When you activate the plug-in, "Add banner" menu is added to the left main menu of the administration screen. Please register and edit from there.

Press the "Choose Image" button at Edit banner page, to open the Media Uploader.
Please select an existing image or upload an image.
The image URL can also be written as a relative path.

In the "How display", you can choose whether to display it under the body of the posted article or display it with a shortcode.

When displaying with shortcode, overwriting the short code number takes precedence. However, "id" is not displayed unless it is registered in the administration screen.

If you check "Filter by category", banner will be displayed on category page of registered category. Multiple images can be displayed in the same category. If you do not check it, the banner is displayed unconditionally on all pages.

You can set class and ID in the image. Please use it for measurement with tag manager and adjustment of style sheet.

When the banner is displayed, the banner image is surrounded by the following tags.
You can use it by adjusting the style sheet.
